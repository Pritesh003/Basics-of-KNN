### Basics-of-KNN
This is a very basic yet interesting example of clustering using KNN.
### There are two notebooks for KNN:

 - One uses only 6 data points, each point represents a country's geographical coordinates and then clustering is done using KNN (using different number of clusters).

 - The second notebook contains many data points for almost every country and again KNN is used for clustering the data set.
