### Basics-of-KNN
This is a very basic yet interesting example of clustering using KNN.
### There are two notebooks for KNN:

 - **Basics of cluster analysis**: It uses only 6 data points (Country clusters.csv), each point represents a country's geographical coordinates and then clustering is done using KNN (using different number of clusters).

 - **Clustering categorical data** The second notebook contains many data points (Categorical.csv) for almost every country and again KNN is used for clustering the data set.
